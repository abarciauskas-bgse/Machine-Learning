* Fundamental inequalities: *slide 1*
* General description of how we study **maximal deviations of empirical frequencies from their expectations**: *slide 2*
* Infinite classes and symmetrization by ghost sample: *slide 3*
* Definition of the shatter coefficient: *slide 4*
    * **The shatter coefficient of a class $\mathcal{C}$ is the number of possible ways n data points can be classified in $\mathcal{C}$**
    * The *effective* number of classifiers
* Bounding the rademacher average using the shater coefficient: *slide 4*
* Applications of bounds for empirical risk minimization with example in half-lines and intervals: *slide 5*
* Definition of VC dimension: *slide 6*
* Sauer's Lemma (bound on shatter coefficient using VC dimension): *slide 6*
* Examples of shatter coefficients and VC dimensions: *slide 7*
