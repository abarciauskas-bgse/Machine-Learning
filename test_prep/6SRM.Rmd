How do we choose a class of classifier? Approximation and Estimation errors are in conflict.

* Definition **estimation** and **approximation errors**: *slide 1*
* Comparing classifiers using the VC dimension: *slide 2*
  * *My example*: Select a $k$ for $k-nn$ for which the true risk of the data-based classifier and it's empirical risk are minimal. *How can we estimate the true risk? LOO?*
* **Minimize empirical error with regularization term**: *slide 2*
* Bound of the expected value of the data based classifer from the true risk: *slide 3*
* Upper bund of the estimation error: *slide 3*
