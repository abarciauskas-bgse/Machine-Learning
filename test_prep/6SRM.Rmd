How do we choose a class of classifier? Approximation and Estimation errors are in conflict.

* Definition **estimation** and **approximation errors**: *slide 1*
* Selecting classifiers using the VC dimension: *slide 2*
    * **How to minimize empirical error with regularization term**: *slide 2*
* Bound of the expected value of the data based classifer from the true risk: *slide 3*
* Upper bound of the estimation error: *slide 3*
