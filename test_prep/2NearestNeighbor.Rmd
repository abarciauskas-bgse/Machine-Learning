## Additional / Alternative Definitions

$\mathbb{I}_{g_{k}(X) = 0, Y = 1} = \mathbb{P}\big\{ Bin(k, \eta(x)) < \frac{k}{2} | X \big\}$


## Nearest Neighbor Theorem

If $X_{n}'(X)$ are the $k$ nearest neighbors of $X$ from the training set $X_{n}$ ($X_{1},...,X_{n}$) are i.i.d in a seperable metrix space), then: $$ X_{n}' \to X$$

In other words, they are "close" to $X$ in a sense that they are asymptotically co-located.

## Proof of Nearest Neighbor Theorem:

To prove the theorem, we prove the probability that the converse happens goes to zero exponentially fast.

We define "good" points as those with positive probabaility that they fall in $S_{x}(\delta)$ centered at $x$ with radius $\delta$, e.g.: $\forall \delta > 0 \text{, } \mathbb{P}\{S_{x}(\delta)\} > 0$

Since the training points are independent, the probabiltiy that all training points lie outside the $S_{x}(\delta)$ is the probability of each individual training point lies outside $S_{x}(\delta)$, which is the $n-th$ power of the individual probability:

Formally:

$\newline$
$\mathbb{P}\big\{d(X_{n}'(x), x) > 0\big\} = \mathbb{P}\big\{X_{n}'(x) \notin S_{x}(r) \big\} = \big(1 - \mathbb{P}\{ S_{x}(\delta)\}\big)^{n} \to 0$


## Rate of Convergence to $R^{*}$

Depends on distribution (*slide 4a*)

$\newline \mathbb{P}\{Bin(n,\frac{1}{2} = 0 or n\} = 2^{-n} + 2^{-n}, \text{ probability there is not at least one data point in each of two disjoint buckets}$
